# 1. 8-puzzle depth-fs solution
solve a 8-puzzle game using depth first search algorithm, and print the initial puzzle and the steps to solution into a solution.txt file, and also print the over all cost of the solution, then show all the steps visually on the puzzle board.

## Requirements:
- Don't use any library or online code.
- Each move will cost you 1
- Print the initial board and all the steps and the over all cost to a file names solution.txt
- Feel free to use any library or code to save the solution.txt file ( nicer is better )
- Use puzzle_board module provided here
- All computation must be done in background and only the solution should be shown on the GUI

## Tools/Libraries Suggested:
- You can use create a new file and use the code in it to start ( moving and GUI and puzzle array are provided ) 
- after getting the random puzzle from the module, feel free to cone and edit the variable shape or do any thing in order to solve the task

puzzle goal:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0

the board is random on each program run

# 2. 8-puzzle breadth-fs solution
solve a 8-puzzle game using breadth first search algorithm, and print the initial puzzle and the steps to solution into a solution.txt file, and also print the over all cost of the solution, then show all the steps visually on the puzzle board.

# 4. vacuum depth-fs solution
solve a vacuum search using depth first search algorithm, and print the initial board and the steps to solution into a solution.txt file, and also print the over all cost of the solution, then show all the steps visually on the vacuum board. if there is no solution the board should be printed into solution.txt and put a text which says there is no solution because of obstacles.

## Requirements:
